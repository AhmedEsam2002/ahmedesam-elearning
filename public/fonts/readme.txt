The Arabic font is completely free, and it is considered the second version that bears the name of my dear father, may God have mercy on him, after the font of Abd Elrady, the first version, which you can see > from HERE:

And as it is known that despite the large number of fonts, each of us has some fonts that we prefer and use routinely. This font is different from the previous one in that it is much simpler and has a familiar and coordinated shape, which makes it more likely to be one of the most used fonts throughout the day, which you can add to your favorite default fonts

In fact, I completed this font about a year and a half ago, and I was hoping to include it in Google Fonts, but I couldn't

I hope you like it, and I will keep updating the font link if I discover any flaws over time
